*** Workspace:
This app is example how can be orginized and implemented HelperTool for OS X app.
FileInfoApp.xcworkspace contains 2 main projects:
1) FileInfoApp.xcodeproj - main OS X application.
2) FileProcessorTool.xcodeproj - HelperTool.
and folder “Utils” which contains:
1) Unistall.sh - script to remove everything installed by the sample.
2) SMJobBlessUtil.py - tool for checking and correcting apps that use SMJobBless.
3) SMJobBlessUtil.txt - example how to use codeSign check and how to fix codeSign.
4) README.txt - this file.


*** Dependecies:
FileProcessorTool projects contains 2 targets:
- FileProcessorInterface - it’s framework which shares Interface for remote object which will be obtained from XPC connection, also it shares name of helperTool by which main app will be connected to HelperTool.
- FileProcessorTool - directly HelperTool.

Both those targets included to FileInfoApp.


*** Usability / Logic:
- Files cab be added by “+” button.
- All files will be saved in Database.
- Each file has some properties, which can be calculated by filePath, and properties which can’t, for example, hash and size. For properties which should be calculated will be used HelperTool.
- Also app contains actions with files. “Remove from DB” and “Remove from Disk”, for first action, file will be removed from database, but for second it will be removed from disk and from database too. For action “Remove from Disk”, will be used HelperTool.


*** HelperTool installing:
- HelperTool will be installed on demand - when user select calculating some property.
Installing operation contains next stages:
- Get Authorization for our HelperTool - on this step user should enter his password.
- Using this Authorization and SMJobBless - install and run our HelperTool.
- Connect to HelperTool by XPC service.

For uninstall use “Uninstall.sh” script.


*** Conditions for re-use:
1) ID: Change "com.alexost.fileinfoapp.FileProcessorTool" in all files to you HelperTool name:
	- FPToolDefines.m
	- FileProcessorTool-Info.plist
	- FileProcessorTool-Launchd.plist
	- Uninstall.sh
	- README.txt
	- Info.plist (FileInfoApp)
	- FileProcessorTool.xcodeproj -> bundle identifier.
1.1) Optional: Change Product Names.
2) Build (not run!) FileInfoApp target - app (product) needed for step #3.1
3) Sign: Select your team and check your MacOS Developer certificate it should be downloaded and valid.
3.1) Sign: Use example #2 from "SMJobBlessUtil.txt" for code sign fixing.
4) Clean and Run.


*** One more thing.
Project was created using Xcode 8.2 - so storyboard won't compiled and also opened by Xcode with less version.

Let me know if you have some questions.
